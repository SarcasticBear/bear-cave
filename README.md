I am kinda new to the whole Git-Hub scene, but figured I would take a look around. Some Open-Source software I use has homes here, so this is also a means of staying informed and connected to them.

I am a sarcastic Navy Submariner Veteran, Bear, Dad, and Geek. Been involved with computers and technology since I was in diapers, which is saying something since I was born in 1969. Computers were a tad different then.

This is my Git-Hub Sandbox. My place to learn and experiment with shit.
